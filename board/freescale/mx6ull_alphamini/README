How to use U-Boot on AlphaMini development board
----------------------------------------------

- First make sure you have installed the dtc package (device tree compiler):

$ sudo apt-get install device-tree-compiler

- Build U-Boot for AlphaMini development board:

$ make mrproper
$ make mx6ull_alphamini_defconfig
$ make

This generates the u-boot-dtb.imx image in the current directory.

- Flash the u-boot-dtb.imx image into the micro SD card:

$ sudo dd if=u-boot-dtb.imx of=/dev/sdb bs=1K seek=1 && sync

- Jumper settings:

SW: 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0

Where 0 means bottom position and 1 means top position (from the switch label
numbers reference).

Connect the USB cable between the board and the PC for the console.

Insert the micro SD card in the board, power it up and U-Boot messages should
come up.
